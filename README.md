# week 1
- introduction between myself and my mentor Mr Solomon Tash from Kenya
- he was so welcoming and encouraging,shared his experience in open hardware making and I have got a lot to learn from him
- he also took me briefly through the OHM curriculum
- I shared all my challenges and among them are:
 
- **Materials for prototyping**
 
- **Tools**
 
- **Data to keep me active and collaborative throughout the project**
- He lastly urged me to follow the OHM calendar for cohort calls and was direct to me that incase of any question,I should also write an email direct to OHM management.
- encouraged me to read OHM curriculum to guide me through my project,of which I had already raed and understood what working open means in hardware projects.
- We closed happily,and my journey to Open Hardware Maker began.
